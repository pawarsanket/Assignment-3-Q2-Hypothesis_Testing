They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

Using Anova test
 Assume Ho :- All TAT population means are same
 Assume Ha :- Atleast one sample TAT population mean is different
 p_value<0.05
 Go with Ha(take necessary action)
